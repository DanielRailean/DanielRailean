# 🖐 Hi, I’m Daniel Railean

- 🚧 I’m currently working on [money.ddlele.com](https://money.ddlele.com) and [PoolTrack.net](https://pooltrack.net)
- 📫 Feel free to write me an email

## 💼 My 3 Most recent Projects:
### 💵 [MoneyTrack](https://money.ddlele.com)
> **A personal finance app** built as a web-application with **.NET API** and SQLite database in the back-end and **Svelte.js** in the front-end. The app makes use of **JWT** for user authentication to create a pleasant user experience and easily keep track of personal finance.
### 🤖 [PoolTrack.net](https://pooltrack.net)
> **A data aggregation** and **emailing subscription service** built using **Express.js** and **Node.js** in the back-end and **Svelte.js** in the front-end. The app consumes the **Ethereum mining-pools API** to get last address data and **emails it daily** to the user.
### 🍕 [GodEats](https://github.com/godeats/sep3) - not currently hosted
>A project build during 3rd Semester at VIA UC meant to be a **food subscription** management service built using the three tier architecture with a presentation tier for which C# and the **Blazor Framework** was utilized, a business tier, for which C# was used for its WebApi functionality, and a data tier, for which Java and the **Spring framework** was used, together with Hibernate ORM and SQLite database. The networking is REST over **HTTPS** for inter tier communication and **SignalR** for the live-chat functionality. The resulting product is a web-application that is able to handle user orders and with small improvement would be able to work in production.
